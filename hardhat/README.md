# L2Fi Dex

This is for an orderbook dex of L2Fi.
It comes with contracts, tests for that contract, and scripts that deploys that contract.

If you want to set local(hardhat) env, try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
nvm use 14.15.0
yarn install
hardhat node
hardhat run scripts/deploy-local.ts
```
